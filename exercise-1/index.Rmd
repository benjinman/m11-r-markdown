# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetMovieReview <- function(movie) {
  # Replace all of the spaces in your movie title with plus signs (+)
  movie.no.spaces <- gsub(" ", "+", movie)
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  base.url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?"
  api.key <- "bf4c8046353e4493bbd1d05e644b7b64"
  request <- paste0(base.url, "api-key=", api.key, "&query=", movie.no.spaces)
  # Request data using your search query
  data <- fromJSON(request)
  
  # What type of variable does this return?
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  flattened <- flatten(data$results)
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  first.review <- flattened[1, ]
  headline <- first.review$headline
  summary.short <- first.review$summary_short
  link <- first.review$link.url
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  return(list(headline = headline, summary = summary.short, link = link))
}
# Test that your function works with a movie of your choice
GetMovieReview("Almost Famous")
